You can now pass URL query parameters (`utm_source`, `ref`, etc.) from your short link to its destination URL.

If there are any duplicate parameters, the parameter in the short link will override its counterpart in the destination URL.

For example:

- [internal-short.shopmy.com.au/oss](https://internal-short.shopmy.com.au/oss) redirects to `vercel.com/oss?ref=dub`
- [internal-short.shopmy.com.au/oss?ref=internal-short.shopmy.com.au](https://internal-short.shopmy.com.au/oss?ref=dub.sh) redirects to `vercel.com/oss?ref=dub.sh`
